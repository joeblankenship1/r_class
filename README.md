# R Class

These are lessons I created as part of an introductory course in R. This goes from basic R functionality to a capstone exercise of running a multiple linear regression.

The files are in Jupyter Notebook format, so you need to make sure that you install the [IRkernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel) to make R works in Jupyter. Some files are also in Rhtml and can be ran in Rstudio in order to follow along while the content is being reviewed and discussed. 

**Please submit issues or pull requests if you think something is wrong or can be improved.**
